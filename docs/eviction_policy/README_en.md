# FlexKV Cache Eviction Policy Guide

This document describes all cache eviction policies supported by FlexKV, including their behavior, configuration, and applicable scenarios.

---

## Overview

FlexKV is a multi-tier cache layer (CPU memory / SSD / lake storage) that sits below the GPU; the GPU KV cache itself is managed by the inference engine and is not subject to FlexKV's eviction. When a cache tier (CPU/SSD/lake) runs low on space or its utilization exceeds the configured threshold, FlexKV evicts (removes) cached blocks from **that tier's Radix Tree** to free space for new requests. The **eviction policy** determines which cached blocks are removed first.

---

## Multi-Level Cache Inclusion

FlexKV uses an approximately **inclusive / write-through** multi-level cache model. During `put`, data is written to the CPU cache first; if SSD or lake storage is enabled and available, FlexKV also tries to fill the blocks that are missing in those lower tiers. As a result, the same KV block usually has copies in multiple cache tiers.

With this model, eviction in one tier only removes blocks from the **current tier's** index and recycles physical block space in that tier. Eviction itself does not trigger write-back, migration, or extra transfer to the next lower tier. For example, CPU eviction does not actively issue CPU→SSD transfers, and SSD eviction does not actively issue SSD→lake transfers.

Note that this inclusion property is **best-effort**. If a lower tier is disabled, skipped by a temporary cache strategy, lacks free space, or fails during transfer, that tier may not contain a copy. After an upper-tier eviction in such cases, later requests can only hit other existing tiers or fall back to a cache miss.

## Supported Eviction Policies

| Policy | Description | Eviction Order |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `lru` | Least Recently Used | Evicts the **least recently accessed** nodes first |
| `lfu` | Least Frequently Used | Evicts the **least frequently accessed** nodes first; ties broken by LRU |
| `slru` | Segmented Least Recently Used | Splits nodes into probationary and protected segments; evicts **least recently accessed** nodes in the probationary segment first |
| `fifo` | First In First Out | Evicts the **oldest inserted** nodes first |
| `mru` | Most Recently Used | Evicts the **most recently accessed** nodes first |
| `filo` | First In Last Out | Evicts the **most recently inserted** nodes first |

### Default Policy

The default eviction policy is `lru`, which is suitable for most inference serving scenarios.

---

## Configuration

### Via Configuration File

```yml
eviction_policy: lru
```

Or using JSON:

```json
{
  "eviction_policy": "lru"
}
```

### Via Environment Variable

```bash
export FLEXKV_EVICTION_POLICY=lru
```

Supported values: `lru`, `lfu`, `slru`, `fifo`, `mru`, `filo`.

## Eviction-Related Configuration

In addition to `eviction_policy` itself, FlexKV provides the following configuration options to control eviction behavior. All options can be set via environment variables or configuration files.

| Option | Environment Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|---------------------|------|---------|-------------|
| `eviction_policy` | `FLEXKV_EVICTION_POLICY` | str | `lru` | Eviction policy, see [Supported Eviction Policies](#supported-eviction-policies) for available values |
| `evict_start_threshold` | `FLEXKV_EVICT_START_THRESHOLD` | float | `0.7` | Cache utilization threshold to trigger proactive eviction. When cache usage reaches this ratio, FlexKV begins proactively evicting nodes. For example, `0.7` means eviction starts when cache is 70% full; setting to `1.0` means eviction only occurs when cache is completely full |
| `evict_ratio` | `FLEXKV_EVICT_RATIO` | float | `0.05` | Minimum eviction ratio per eviction round. For example, `0.05` means at least 5% of total blocks are evicted each round, reducing overhead from frequent small evictions. Setting to `0.0` evicts only the minimum blocks needed to satisfy the current request |
| `hit_reward_seconds` | `FLEXKV_HIT_REWARD_SECONDS` | int | `0` | Hit reward in seconds, only effective for the LRU policy. Each cache hit adds the specified seconds to the node's effective access time (stackable), making frequently hit nodes harder to evict. Set to `0` for standard LRU behavior. Note: this parameter has no effect on other policies (LFU/SLRU/FIFO/MRU/FILO) |
| `slru_protected_threshold` | `FLEXKV_SLRU_PROTECTED_THRESHOLD` | int | `2` | Protected threshold for the SLRU policy. Nodes with hit count reaching this value are promoted to the protected segment and become harder to evict. Only effective for the SLRU policy |

### Configuration Examples

**Via environment variables:**
```bash
export FLEXKV_EVICTION_POLICY=lru
export FLEXKV_EVICT_START_THRESHOLD=0.7
export FLEXKV_EVICT_RATIO=0.05
export FLEXKV_HIT_REWARD_SECONDS=10
```

**Via configuration file (yml):**
```yml
eviction_policy: lru
evict_start_threshold: 0.7
evict_ratio: 0.05
hit_reward_seconds: 10
```

### Eviction Trigger Mechanism

FlexKV triggers eviction when either of the following conditions is met:

1. **Cache utilization exceeds threshold**: current cache utilization ≥ `evict_start_threshold`
2. **Insufficient free blocks**: blocks needed by the current request > available free blocks

Once eviction is triggered, the actual number of evicted blocks is the maximum of:
- Minimum blocks needed to satisfy the current request
- Blocks needed to bring utilization back below the threshold
- `evict_ratio × total blocks` (minimum batch eviction)

## Policy Details

### LRU (Least Recently Used)

- **Priority Value**: `last_access_time`
- **Behavior**: Nodes that have not been accessed for the longest time are evicted first.
- **Best For**: General-purpose serving workloads where recently used prefixes are likely to be reused.

#### LRU Enhancement: `hit_reward_seconds`

FlexKV provides an optional **hit reward** mechanism to enhance LRU with frequency awareness. When `hit_reward_seconds` is configured (default `0`, i.e., standard LRU behavior), each cache hit adds extra seconds to the node's effective access time (stackable), making frequently hit nodes harder to evict.

**Configuration**:
```bash
export FLEXKV_HIT_REWARD_SECONDS=10
```
Or in a config file:
```yml
hit_reward_seconds: 10
```

### LFU (Least Frequently Used)

- **Priority Value**: `(hit_count, last_access_time)`
- **Behavior**: Nodes with the fewest cache hits are evicted first. When two nodes have the same hit count, the one accessed least recently is evicted first.
- **Best For**: Workloads with highly skewed access patterns where some system prompts or prefixes are reused far more than others.

### FIFO (First In First Out)

- **Priority Value**: `creation_time`
- **Behavior**: Nodes that were inserted earliest are evicted first, regardless of access patterns.
- **Best For**: Scenarios where cache freshness is more important than reuse frequency, or when you want predictable eviction order.

### MRU (Most Recently Used)

- **Priority Value**: `-last_access_time`
- **Behavior**: Nodes that were accessed most recently are evicted first. This is the reverse of LRU.
- **Best For**: Workloads where recently accessed items are unlikely to be reused soon (e.g., one-shot queries with unique prefixes).

### FILO (First In Last Out)

- **Priority Value**: `-creation_time`
- **Behavior**: The most recently inserted nodes are evicted first. This is the reverse of FIFO.
- **Best For**: Scenarios where older cached content is more valuable and should be preserved longer.

### SLRU (Segmented Least Recently Used)

- **Priority Value**: `(is_protected, last_access_time)`
- **Behavior**: Logically splits cached nodes into two segments:
  - **Probationary segment**: Nodes with `hit_count < protected_threshold` (default 2). Newly inserted nodes enter this segment by default.
  - **Protected segment**: Nodes with `hit_count >= protected_threshold`. Nodes that are accessed multiple times are automatically promoted to this segment.
  
  During eviction, nodes in the Probationary segment are evicted first; within the same segment, LRU ordering applies (least recently accessed nodes are evicted first). Protected segment nodes are only evicted after all Probationary segment nodes have been evicted.
- **Best For**: Mixed workloads with both frequently reused system prompts and large volumes of one-shot queries. SLRU effectively resists cache scan pollution, preventing large batches of one-time requests from flushing out frequently used cache entries.
- **Note**: SLRU orders same-segment nodes by `last_access_time`, so `hit_reward_seconds` (which only affects `grace_time`) has no effect on SLRU.

**Configuration**:
```bash
export FLEXKV_EVICTION_POLICY=slru
export FLEXKV_SLRU_PROTECTED_THRESHOLD=2  # Optional, default is 2
```
Or in a config file:
```yml
eviction_policy: slru
slru_protected_threshold: 2
```
